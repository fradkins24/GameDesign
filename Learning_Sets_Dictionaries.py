#DICTIONARIES
myDictionary={"Name1":"Peter", "Age1":18, "School1":"Greenhill"} #definition of key name1 is peter because of:
print("The name of the student is",myDictionary["Name1"]) #prints string, then definition of name 1
print(myDictionary.keys())

#DICTIONARY ASSIGNMENT

#1 sort a dictionary (acsending and decsending) by value
dict1={"fruit":"apple","number":1}
#print(dict1.sort())

#2 add key to dictionary
dict1["vegatable"]="eggplant" #adds new entry/key
print(dict1)

#3 concatenate (add, link) dictionaries together
dict2={"a":1,"b":2}
dict3={"c":3,"d":4}
dict2.update(dict3) #updates dict2 to make it both
print("%s"%dict2) #ASK WHAT THI MEANS

#4 check if key exists
thisdict={"name":"Sarah","age":14}
if "name" in thisdict: #if there is a key called name
    print("My name is",thisdict["name"]) #print this
else: #if not
    thisdict["name"]="Sarah" #add it

#5 print dictionary using for loop
mydict={"one":1,"two":2,"three":3}
for x,y in mydict.items(): #for items x and y in mydict
    print(x,y) #print the items x and y

#6 squares of numbers between 1 and n
n=3 #declare variable
dicta={} #create empty dict
for i in range(1,n+1): #make loop with variable i between 1 and n
    dicta[i]=i*i #adds a key(i) and makes the value the square of i
print(dicta) #prints resulting dict

#7 numbers 1-15 squared
dictb={} #same logic as 6
for m in range(1,16):
    dictb[m]=m*m
print(dictb)

#8 merge dicts
#LOOK AT #3

#9 iterate(print) using for loop
#LOOK AT #5
